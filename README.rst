Tutorial
========

Since we will be predominantly using Twisted within the Zynq to manage
the Reactor workflow ("callbacks"), I suggest reading through `this
tutorial <http://krondo.com/?page_id=1327>`__ on your own time to get up
to speed on how it works and some details of sockets.

I'm following the guide based on ``sandman``
`here <https://www.jeffknupp.com/blog/2013/08/16/open-sourcing-a-python-project-the-right-way/>`__

To Do
-----

-  split udp and tcp into different, separate protocols:
   http://stackoverflow.com/questions/33224142/twisted-protocol-that-simultaneously-handles-tcp-and-udp-at-once

Ideas
-----

-  make it like twisted.web - we build Request objects which need to
   find Resource objects that provide actions (maybe too complicated,
   try and simplify?)
   `link <http://twistedmatrix.com/trac/browser/trunk/twisted/web>`__
